hello community, hello peers,

I had a huge datacrash and recoverd some old versions of my programms. As I lost alot I have no intention to redo them. This is what has risen from the dead and I am thankful for that. So I share that stuff with you. Maybe someone can make use of it.

The purpose of this tools is to collect books to study them offgrid where rent is cheap and secure themagainst violent actors. some personal and unrelated stuff could be in there also, but I dont care. Hope you can find some value
