## sorter

Let you quick rename all document pictures and let you seperate them from private pictures. 
Shows all photos and videos in the current directory for quick sorting.
It removes all exif data and reduces the quality, let you choose between reduced and very reduced.

It helps you to sort between the catogories
- organic
- documents

I use this tool always after calling "adb pull /sdcard/DCIM ."

### when you need this?

If you want to have a searchable archive of all kinds of documents. Just photo them when ever you come accross them. Later you can easily seperate them from your personal photos by just two keystrokes.
I use this tool multiple times a month to keep my smartphone empty of photos and sort them into my safe storage without getting a mess. I have now pictures (private and documents) from the last years, all named and sorted only containing a few 100 MB.

### ATTENTION

ALL EXISTING SUBDIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF THE DIR IN WHICH YOU RUN THE COMMAND GETS DESTROYED, files get moved into current directory.


### Not perfekt, but it does what it should

No errorcases get catched. You have to close vlc throuch ctrl+c if there is no video for example. Feel free to add some conditions. I am just too busy to change this for me already sufficient tool.
