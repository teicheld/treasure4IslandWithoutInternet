#doublicateFinder

## how are the files identified?

- first by same size, then by sha1sum.

## return

- it outputs a list of files called 2rm.txt and prints them to stdout also.

### improvement needed

- only a double per file gets found. Run this tool as many times until it does not return anything anymore. Sorry, but for my usecase its sufficient.
